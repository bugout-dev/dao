Moonstream DAO

**NOTE: All important code in this repository has been moved to https://github.com/moonstream-to/web3**

## Decentralizing Moonstream

[Moonstream](https://moonstream.to) makes tools which help people build, manage, and maintain their blockchain economies.

Moonstream's off-chain infrastructure is currently hosted and managed by the team at Moonstream.to (https://moonstream.to).
We run our own blockchain nodes (currently Ethereum and Polygon), and perform all Moonstream operations
through these nodes.

The coming years will bring an explosion of decentralized applications with a presence on multiple
blockchains. We aim to bring the value of Moonstream to *every* major blockchain, and to do so in a
truly decentralized manner. No other approach will scale to tens and eventually hundreds of supported
blockchains.

Moonstream DAO represents this decentralization. The DAO will reward participants who contribute:
1. Blockchain node time
2. Crawler time
3. Crawler code
4. Storage for the Moonstream databases
5. Publicity for Moonstream
6. Documentation
7. Moonstream token liquidity

Rewards will be distributed as a share of revenue, represented in Moonstream platform tokens.

As strong believers in decentralization, all our code is already open source and freely licensed (Apache 2.0
and MIT): https://github.com/bugout-dev.

## Architecture and deployments

### The Moonstream platform token

This is an ERC20 token that represents the value that Moonstream provides our customers, and the value
Moonstream participants provide to the DAO.

### Terminus

[The Terminus whitepaper](./docs/terminus.md)

This is a decentralized authorization platform, which we use to manage permissions in the Moonstream
DAO and our customers use for a variety of use cases, including whitelisting their token sales and
representing in-game achievements for on-chain games.

You can find the addresses for all Moonstream DAO contracts on our [`operations`](./operations/README.md) page.

## Development

### Preparing your development environment

Moonstream DAO is built with Solidity, Python, and shell scripts.

We use [`brownie`](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) to build our smart contracts, deploy them,
and perform operations on them.

We use [`moonworm`](https://github.com/bugout-dev/moonworm) to generate Python interfaces to our smart
contracts from their ABIs.

To set up an environment in which you can develop on Moonstream DAO, first create a Python3 environment.

Using the built in `venv` module:

```bash
python3 -m venv .dao
```

Then make sure that this new environment is active. If you used `venv` as above:

```bash
source .dao/bin/activate
```

Install the Python dependencies and developer dependencies for `dao`:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Install the Solidity dependencies for Moonstream DAO smart contracts:

```bash
brownie pm install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.2
```

### Compiling the smart contracts

```bash
brownie compile
```

### Generating interfaces to the smart contracts

We use `moonworm` to generate command-line and Python interfaces to our smart contracts.

Every time you add, remove, or modify an `external` or `public` method from a Solidity smart contract in this repository,
make sure to regenerate its Python interface.

You can do this by activating your Python development environment and running the following command from
the repository root:

```bash
moonworm generate-brownie -p . -o dao -n "<name of Solidity contract you modified>"
```

For example, if you modified the `TerminusFacet` contract, you would then run this command:

```bash
moonworm generate-brownie -p . -o dao -n TerminusFacet
```

### Tests

To run unit tests, run: `./test.sh`

Before you do this, you must make sure that a Python environment is available in your shell and that
you have installed the development dependencies in this environment.

### VSCode setup

If you are using the Solidity extension in VSCode, merge the following snippet into your settings.json:

```json
{
    "solidity.remappings": [
        "@openzeppelin-contracts/=<path to your home directory>/.brownie/packages/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.2"
    ]
}
```
